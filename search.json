    "text": "Below are some exercises that should help you learn the most important basic built in functions and how to incorporate them into your own functions. This sheet focuses on vectors and how the easily generated.\n\n\nThe most challenging aspect of R is probably its flexibility. All these lines do exactly the same thing!\n\nvec_z &lt;- 1:6\nvec_z &lt;- seq(1, 6)\nvec_z &lt;- seq(1, 6, 1)\nvec_z &lt;- seq(from = 1, to = 6, by = 1)\nvec_z &lt;- seq_len(6)\nvec_z\n\n[1] 1 2 3 4 5 6\n\n\nTry to generate this sequence\n\n\n[1] 1 3 5\n\n\n\n\n\nA second way to generate vectors is by using this:\n\nrep(x = 5, times = 4)\n\n[1] 5 5 5 5\n\n\nTry to generate this sequence\n\n\n[1] 1 3 1 3 1 3 1 3\n\n\nAnd try now to generate this sequence with the same function\nHint: you will need a other parameter then times (?rep)\n\n\n[1] 1 1 1 1 3 3 3 3\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, the built-in functions are very flexible and can define many diferent vectors. Now for something trickier.\nCreate a function that takes a single integer n and generates a sequence with all natural numbers from 1 to n, such that each number x is repeated x number of times. Here are some examples of desired output:\n\nincremental_seq(1)\n\n[1] 1\n\nincremental_seq(2)\n\n[1] 1 2 2\n\nincremental_seq(3)\n\n[1] 1 2 2 3 3 3\n\nincremental_seq(4)\n\n [1] 1 2 2 3 3 3 4 4 4 4\n\nincremental_seq(5)\n\n [1] 1 2 2 3 3 3 4 4 4 4 5 5 5 5 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nRead carefully the documentation for the rep function by typing ?rep or help(rep) in the R console. Specifically look at the explanation of the times argument in the Details section. What happens when times is not a single number but a vector instead?\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this task you have to do almost the reverse of the previous. Given a vector of items, determine how often each item is repeated in an uninterupted sequence and print a summary. Example output:\n\nsummarise_reps(c(\"A\", \"A\", \"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"C\", \"M\", \"M\", \"M\", \"M\", \"A\", \"A\"))\n\nValue: A, Reps: 3\nValue: B, Reps: 1\nValue: C, Reps: 2\nValue: M, Reps: 4\nValue: A, Reps: 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou can do this with low-level functions. You could also search for a concept called “Run Length Encoding”. Is there a base R function that computes the run length encoding? What type of object does it return? How can you extract the information you need from that object?"

It is designed to equip students with foundational programming skills and the computational tools necessary for modern research and data analysis in both academic and industry settings.\nStudents will learn core programming concepts, including data structures, control statements, loops, custom function creation, code optimization, and debugging. The course will emphasize practical skills, such as working with a command-line terminal, implementing version control with Git and GitHub, and structuring and organizing coding projects for clarity and reproducibility. Advanced topics will include parallelization techniques and deploying code on high-performance computing clusters.\nGood coding practices, including documentation, testing, and maintaining clean, efficient code, will be a central focus, ensuring students are prepared for collaborative and reproducible research environments.\nThe skills developed in this course will lay the groundwork for more advanced courses in the program and are directly applicable to coding psychological experiments, implementing advanced analytic techniques, and developing computational models. By the end of the course, students will have the confidence and competence to apply programming to solve complex research problems and bridge the gap between computational methods and psychological inquiry."

This sheet focuses on letters and strings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn the exercises below, the symbol GAP is a placeholder. You should replace it with appropriate commands to solve the problem.\n\n\n\n\nLet’s start with the obligatory ‘Hello World’.\n\ngreet &lt;- function() {\n  print(\"Hello world\")\n}\n\n\ngreet()\n\n[1] \"Hello world\"\n\n\n\n\n\nSince the first example was very impersonal, now write a function that uses your name.\ngreet_person &lt;- function(name) {\n  text &lt;- paste(GAP, name, sep = GAP)\n  print(text)\n}\nIt should output something with it.\n\ngreet_person(\"Hubi\")\n\n[1] \"Hello Hubi\"\n\n\n\n\n\nTo make it a bit more exciting, the next function should output something different depending on the time of day. You should use the if and else statements we learned in class to complete the assignment.\nHere is a helper function to determine the current hour of the day:\n\ncurrent_hour &lt;- function() {\n  # get the current time from the machine \n  current_time &lt;- Sys.time()\n\n  # extract the hour from the full time string \n  hour_string &lt;- format(current_time, \"%H\")\n\n  # convert to a number and return \n  # return() is unnecessary: functions return the value of the last expression\n  as.numeric(hour_string) \n}\n\nYou can use it like this:\n\ncurrent_hour()\n\n[1] 22\n\n\nFill out the body of the function below so that the function should print ‘Good morning’ until 12, and after that, print ‘Good afternoon’:\ngreet_time &lt;- function(name, hour = current_hour()) {\n  # put code here\n}\nBy default the function should use the current time, but to test it you can give it directly the hour as an argument:\n\ngreet_time(\"Hubi\")\n\n[1] \"Good afternoon Hubi\"\n\ngreet_time(\"Hubi\", hour = 11)\n\n[1] \"Good morning Hubi\"\n\ngreet_time(\"Hubi\", hour = 13)\n\n[1] \"Good afternoon Hubi\"\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the last exercise wasn’t fancy enough, you can extend it as follows:\nif (condition1) {\n  # something happens here if condition1 is TRUE\n} else if (condition2) {\n  # something else happens here if condition1 is FALSE but condition2 is TRUE\n} else {\n  # a final thing happens if both condition1 and condition2 are FALSE\n}\nMay something like that ;-)\n\nvery_fancy_greet(\"Hubi\", hour = 23)\n\n[1] \"Go to bed Hubi\"\n\n\n\n\n\nGoal: Write a function which reverses a string and makes all letters uppercase.\nYour function should do this\n\nrev_string(\"Hubi\")\n\n[1] \"IBUH\"\n\n\nHere are some tips. A very useful function that you might use at some point during data preparation is this:\n\nwords &lt;- strsplit(\"Hello World\", split = \" \")\n\nThe result is here a List of words\n\nwords\n\n[[1]]\n[1] \"Hello\" \"World\"\n\nwords[[1]] # vector\n\n[1] \"Hello\" \"World\"\n\n\nYou can also use this for a own function that reverses a string.\nhint: you may also use following built in functions from R\n\ntoupper(\"text\")\n\n[1] \"TEXT\"\n\nrev(c(1, 2, 3))\n\n[1] 3 2 1\n\n\nCombine the functions above in order to complete assignment.\n\n\n\nIf you’ve mastered the last exercise, it’s just a small step to write a function that checks if a word is a palindrome.\nYour function should give out TRUE if the word is a palindrome.\nHint: You can use your function “rev_string” inside the new function\n\nis_palindrome(\"Hubi\")\n\n[1] FALSE\n\nis_palindrome(\"Anna\")\n\n[1] TRUE"

Step\nGeneration of a random position for a single dart within a square. The square extends from -1 to +1 in the X-direction, as well as in the Y-direction.\nUse a random number generator for a uniform distribution and save the result in the two variables x and y (GAP are placeholder)\n\nx &lt;- runif(n=GAP,min=GAP,max=GAP)\ny &lt;- GAP\n\n\n\n2. Step\nNow calculate the distance from this position to the center. You can use the following simplified formula for our chosen square\n\ndist &lt;- x**2 + y**2\nprint(dist)\n\n[1] 0.8710378\n\n\n\n\n3. Step\nCreate a decision rule and print “inside” if the point is inside the circle or “outside” if it is not.\n\nif (dist &lt;= GAP){\n  GAP\n} else {\n  GAP\n}\n\n\n\n4. Step\nCreate now a loop (use for or while statement) and execute the code from steps 1 to 3 within it. You should get something like that now\nHint: Use may 10 iteration for the beginning\n\n\n[1] \"outside\"\n[1] \"inside\"\n[1] \"inside\"\n[1] \"inside\"\n[1] \"outside\"\n[1] \"inside\"\n[1] \"outside\"\n[1] \"outside\"\n[1] \"inside\"\n[1] \"inside\"\n\n\n\n\n5. Step\nCopy now the code from Step 4 and modify it in a way that instead of outputting a result for each point, it sums up the number of “insides”.\nUse something like that,\n\nn_insides &lt;- 0\nn_insides &lt;- n_insides + 1\nprint(n_insides)\n\n[1] 1\n\n\nor more elegant write the results in a vector.\n\nv_insides &lt;- rep(x=0,10)\nv_insides[2] &lt;- 1\nprint(v_insides)\n\n [1] 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n\n\nIf you use 1000 iteration you should became such a number\n\n\n[1] 794"
